##Project Outline
This app was created to look at specific websites on ANSPerformance.com to see if they're in stock.
Some of us just can't get enough Rave specifically, so we want to be notified via Telegram when in stock.

###Notes
Create a file (and folder) in /docs/keys.json with telegram_token and telegram_chat_id (keep the quotes)

`{
  "telegram_token": "somektoken",
  "telegram_chat_id": "somechatid"
}`
